# openCV-projects
## Download Python3:-
I made all of my projects using python3, it will be replaced in the future by its succesor but I belive the changes in the syntax will be minimal so if you have python vdersion other than 3.X look out for changes

To download python :- https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Download openCV:- 

1)Command line:- pip3 install opencv3.

2)https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/table_of_content_introduction/table_of_content_introduction.html#table-of-content-introduction
Here you will learn how to download openCV on your respective os and also tutorials on openCV.

## Projects
Here are my projects which I made using openCV module of python.

### Face detection using python
I used the Haar feature-based cascade classifiers for facial detection.


link to download:- https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html


Also you can download the Haar feature-based cascade classifiersfrom my folder but remember to keep it in the same directory as your project/programm.

here you will get the tutorial as well the mechanism of this classifier.You can find my code in this repository by the name of *face_detect_cv3.py*

how to run this in your terminal:- python face_detect_cv3.py * name of the image.ext *

remember to store the image in your program directory.

### Face detection in a webcam using python
I used the Haar feature-based cascade classifiers for facial detection.


You have to run the command in your terminal with the directory where you have stored the python program.

COMMAND:- * face_detection_webcam.py *

Also you can download the Haar feature-based cascade classifiersfrom my folder but remember to keep it in the same directory as your project/programm.
