# openCV-projects
## Download Python3:-
I made all of my projects using python3, it will be replaced in the future by its succesor but I belive the changes in the syntax will be minimal so if you have python version other than 3.X look out for changes in my code

[To download python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Download openCV:- 

1)Command line:- 
```
conda install -c menpo opencv(for windows)
```
2)[FOR OS OTHER THAN WINDOWS](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/table_of_content_introduction/table_of_content_introduction.html#table-of-content-introduction)
Here you will learn how to download openCV on your respective os and also tutorials on openCV.

## HOW TO DOWNLOAD HAAR CASCADE CLASSIFIER FROM GITHUB:-
When you click on the file eg frontal_eye.xml you will enter the code window on top of the window you will have 3 buttons one will be raw click on that. Then you will enter a webpage with the classifier rightclick your mouse and click on the save page as option and then save it in your working directory as an xml file using .xml extension
## Projects
Here are my projects which I made using openCV module of python.

### Face detection using python
I used the Haar feature-based cascade classifiers for facial detection.


[link to download](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html)


Also you can download the Haar feature-based cascade classifiersfrom my folder but remember to keep it in the same directory as your project/programm.

here you will get the tutorial as well the mechanism of this classifier.You can find my code in this repository by the name of 
```
face_detect_cv3.py
```
how to run this in your terminal:- python face_detect_cv3.py 
```
name of the image.ext
```
remember to store the image in your program directory.

### Face,Phone and Eyes detection in a webcam using python
I used the haar cascade classifier for detecting all the things mentioned and can detect other things too if I was given or I created another classifier. I have put every classifier I used in this project please donwload them in the detection folder
along with the detection.py file which is the main python script along with the classifier

## Thug life image editor
I created the script to edit the image and put the thug life specs on the image using eye detction classifier and resize the specs image to fit my eye. I have uploaded all the cascades I used in the thug life folder along with the specs image
