here you will learn how to download openCV on your respective os and also tutorials on openCV

## Projects
here are my projects which I made using openCV module of python

## Face detection using python
I used the Haar feature-based cascade classifiers for facial detection


link to download:- https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_objdetect/py_face_detection/py_face_detection.html


also you can download the Haar feature-based cascade classifiersfrom my folder but remember to keep it in the same directory as your project/programm

here you will get the tutorial as well the mechanism of this classifier.You can find my code in this repository by the name of face_detect_cv3.py

how to run this in your terminal:- python face_detect_cv3.py * name of the image.ext *

remember to store the image in your program directory
